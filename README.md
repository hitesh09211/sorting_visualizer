## Overview

The Sorting Visualizer is a web application that visually demonstrates various sorting algorithms. Users can observe the sorting process in real-time through animated bar graphs, which represent the array being sorted. The application allows users to choose from multiple sorting algorithms, adjust the size and speed of the array, and start/stop the sorting process.

## Features
